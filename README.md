# General Info

This is a [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) extension that forwards amazon.com/.de/.co.uk sites to their equivalent Amazon smile sites. It is useful if you forgot to login to Amazon smile.

# Do You Track My Data?

Absolutely not. The extension simply forwards the www.amazon site to smile.amazon. Source code is available for inspection.

# Planned Improvements

- Do forwarding only when logged into Amazon.
- Add a button to enable/disable the extension.
